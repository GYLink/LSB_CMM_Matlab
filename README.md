# LSB_CMM_Matlab

LSB_CMM is the Matlab implementation of Conditional Multinomial Mixture Model for Superset Label Learning(L. Liu et al.).
This method is based on Logistic Breaking process and EM algorithm.
lsbcmm_fit.m is the main function. Given the parameters, it will fit the model for this partial label learning problem.
runExp.m runs experiments on UCI datasets and three real-world datasets.
